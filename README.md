# About the Project

Initiated at Transilvania University of Bra»ôov, this project aims to streamline the collection and analysis of course feedback. It integrates a 3D printed device with a Raspberry Pi 3A, allowing students to rate their courses on a scale of 1 to 5. The system is complemented by a web application, and an administrative tool, providing a holistic approach to feedback visualization and management.\

## Project features and functionalities

- **3D Printed Box with RaspberryPi:** This device, equipped with rating buttons, offers a straightforward method for students to submit their course feedback.
- **Web Application:** Featuring a user-centric design, the web interface allows for easy access and visualization of course feedback, offering a view of student sentiments.
- **Admin Tool:** The admin tool streamlines database management with efficient Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) functionalities.
- **AI Sentiment Analysist:** Integrated into the system, this script performs sentiment analysis on comments provided in the feedback. It generates an average sentiment score, providing deeper insights into qualitative feedback.
- **Archiving System:** Implemented to store and visualize historical data, enabling users to access and analyze past feedback trends. This system allows for comparisons and trend analysis over time.

## Technologies Used

This project utilizes a range of technologies:

- **Python:** Backed by the Flask framework, it ensures smooth backend operations and integration.
- **Next.js/React:** The front end is crafted using Next.js and React, creating an engaging and responsive user experience.
- **JavaScript:** Adds interactive and dynamic features to the web application.
- **PostgreSQL:** Serves as the robust database management system.
- **RaspberryPi:** Integral to the feedback collection device, facilitating data capture and transmission.
- **3D Printer:** Used to construct the tactile feedback box.
- **Docker:** Streamlines deployment and management through containerization of the database, backend, and frontend.
- **Natural Language Processing:** Utilizes NLP for sentiment analysis on textual feedback.
