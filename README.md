# Feedback UnitBv-IESC

> ## About the Project
>
> This project, initiated by students at Transilvania University of BraÈ™ov, is designed to facilitate the seamless collection and visualization of feedback for various courses. Leveraging a 3D printed device integrated with a RaspberryPi 3A, the system enables students to submit ratings from 1 to 5 for the courses they attend. Alongside the hardware component, the project encompasses a web application, an admin tool, and a Grafana dashboard for comprehensive data analysis.

> ### Key Features
> 
> - **3D Printed Box with RaspberryPi:** Equipped with buttons, the 3D printed box enables students to effortlessly provide course feedback by selecting ratings ranging from 1 to 5.
> - **Web Application:** The user-friendly web interface allows users to access and visualize the feedback for each course, enabling a comprehensive understanding of the students' perspectives.
> - **Admin Tool:** A robust administrative tool facilitates the management of the database, allowing for smooth handling of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations.
> - **Grafana Dashboard:** Leveraging Grafana, the project provides a comprehensive dashboard for in-depth analysis of the collected feedback data, enabling the identification of key trends and insights.

> ## Technologies Used
> 
> The development of this project involved the utilization of the following technologies:
> 
> - **Python:** Leveraging the Flask framework to enable seamless backend development and integration.
> - **HTML/CSS:** Utilized for creating an intuitive and user-friendly web interface.
> - **JavaScript:** Implemented to add interactivity and dynamic elements to the web application.
> - **PostgreSQL:** Employed as the primary database management system for efficient data storage and retrieval.
> - **RaspberryPI:** Integrated into the 3D printed device to facilitate the seamless collection and transmission of feedback data.
> - **3D Printer:** Utilized for the construction of the physical feedback collection box.
> - **Grafana:** Utilized for comprehensive data analysis and visualization, enabling the extraction of valuable insights from the collected feedback.
